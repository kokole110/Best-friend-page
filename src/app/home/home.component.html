			<p>My name is Rocky, I`m the <em>Berneese Mountain Dog</em></p>
			<p>I am <span>{{ displayTimer }}</span> old</p>
			<p>I don't remember where I was born, but now I live in a lovely family somewhere on the Earth</p>
			<p>My favorite hobby is to eat owner's shoes, but looks like they don't really like that, so I need to hide</p>
